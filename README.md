# 📊 Analyzing-Apple-Market-Trends: An-EDA-Approach
*A data-driven exploration of Apple’s performance, products, and market indicators.*

## 📌 **`Project Overview`**

This project focuses on analyzing **Apple’s market trends** using data analytics techniques.
The goal is to understand patterns in Apple’s product performance, pricing trends, customer preferences, and overall market growth using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The project includes:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis using Python
* Visual insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Interpretation of market behavior and trend patterns

5. View the saved graphs inside the *Images* folder

## 🔍 **Key Techniques Used**

* Handling missing values
* Cleaning inconsistent formats
* Feature extraction
* Statistical analysis
* Trend analysis
* Data visualization

## 📈 **`Key Insights `**

These insights are derived from the exploratory data analysis performed in this project. They reflect the patterns observed in the dataset, but further analysis may reveal additional insights.

### 🍎 **1. Variety & Grade Preferences**

* *Delicious* is the most frequently traded apple variety by a huge margin.
* Over **95%** of all apples sold belong to just two grades: **Medium** and **Large**, showing strong market preference for bigger sizes.
* Small-grade apples form less than **5%** of total records, indicating very low demand.

### 🏙️ **2. Pricing Differences Across Districts**

* **Udhampur** consistently records the **highest average apple prices** (₹11,000+/Quintal).
* **Kathua** also shows high pricing, while **Anantnag** and **Badgam** remain the most affordable markets (~₹4,000/Quintal).
* **Srinagar** shows the **widest price variation**, making it the most unpredictable market.
  
### 📉 **3. Supply vs Price Relationship**

* When **arrivals increase**, the **modal price drops** — clear demand–supply behavior.
* The **highest price spikes** (up to ₹35,000/Quintal) occur when arrivals are extremely low.
* These premium prices belong almost entirely to the **Large grade**, highlighting its high value at low supply.

### 🗓️ **4. Seasonal Market Activity**

* Apple records appear **throughout the year**, but market activity surges nearly **20x in April**, showing a seasonal peak.
* Most other months stay steady with low, consistent records.

### 💰 **5. Price Trends by Variety**

* The **‘Apple’ variety** is the **most expensive**, averaging above ₹8,000/Quintal.
* The popular **Delicious variety** maintains a strong price (~₹7,500/Quintal).
* Varieties like **Kesri** and **Condition** are at the bottom with prices around ₹2,500/Quintal.

### 📌 **6. Market Stability & Risk**

* The **American** variety has the **most stable pricing**, making it a reliable trading option.
* **Srinagar** market carries the highest profit potential *but also the highest risk* due to unpredictable price swings.

## 🚀 **`Future Enhancements`**

* Build an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** or **Tableau**
* Add forecasting models to predict future Apple product trends
* Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews
* Automate reports using Python scripts
